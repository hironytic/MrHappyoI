## Description

Mr. Happyo I, aka 発表くん１号, is an automated-presentation app for iOS. All speeches are produced by `AVSpeechSynthesizer` and all slides are shown in `PDFView`.

The idea was [submited](https://fortee.jp/iosdc-japan-2018/proposal/229db830-848e-4496-b863-46f8ba690c5d) to CfP for [iOSDC Japan 2018](https://iosdc.jp/2018/) by [Hiron](https://twitter.com/hironytic). At that time he thought it as a joke proposal, but then he had been interested in realizing the idea and started to work for this app. Few weeks later his proposal was selected and more seven weeks later he [made a presentation](https://youtu.be/bbKroWHw3dY?t=1m4s) about this app, with this app, without speaking any words!
