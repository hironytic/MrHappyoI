## Work in Progress

Mr. Happyo I, aka 発表くん１号, is an automated-presentation app for iOS. All speeches are produced by `AVSpeechSynthesizer` and all slides are shown in `PDFView`.

The idea was [submited](https://fortee.jp/iosdc-japan-2018/proposal/229db830-848e-4496-b863-46f8ba690c5d) to CfP for [iOSDC Japan 2018](https://iosdc.jp/2018/) by [Hiron](https://twitter.com/hironytic). At that time he thought it as a joke proposal, but then he had been interested in realizing the idea and started to work for this app. Few weeks later his proposal was selected and he will do a presentation about this app using itself.
